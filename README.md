This repository contains MATLAB code for simulating calcium or acetylcholine (ACh) responses following D1-MSN and D2-MSN stimulation. The model captures the characteristic fast-rise and slow-decay dynamics of ACh signaling and illustrates how D1- and D2-mediated pathways influence ChAT neuron activity.
The code was tested using MATLAB R2021a.

Usage
1.	Open MATLAB (R2021a or later).
2.	Run the script ACh_Modelling_demo.m or GCaMP_Modelling_demo.m to generate and plot simulation results.
3.	Adjust model parameters as needed to explore different conditions or response kinetics.
